# [Udemy - LangChain 101 for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/langchain-101-for-beginners/)

A great course by **Avinash Jain** a.k.a [TheCodex](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodex)

I like his energy in the course. He's very enthusiastic and his teaching style is very engaging.

Content of the course is very good. It covers a lot of basics and also touches some more advanced topics. It's a great starting point for LangChain.

For me it opened a lot of new ideas and possibilities. I'm looking forward to explore more.

This repository contains code examples from the course which I updated to work with the latest LangChain version (i.e. 0.3.x).
